Program: Write an algorithm that describes the second part of the process of making change
(counting out the coins and bills).
Solution:
    1. An algorithm consists of a finite number of instructions.
    2. Each individual instruction in an algorithm is well defined. This means that the
    action described by the instruction can be performed effectively or be executed
    by a computing agent. For example, any computing agent capable of arithmetic can
    compute the difference between two digits. So an algorithmic step that says “compute the difference between two digits” would be well defined. On the other hand,
    a step that says “divide a number by 0” is not well defined, because no computing
    agent could carry it out.
    3. An algorithm describes a process that eventually halts after arriving at a solution to
    a problem. For example, the process of subtraction halts after the computing agent
    writes down the difference between the two digits in the leftmost column of digits.
    4. An algorithm solves a general class of problems. For example, an algorithm that
    describes how to make change should work for any two amounts of money whose
    difference is greater than or equal to $0.00
