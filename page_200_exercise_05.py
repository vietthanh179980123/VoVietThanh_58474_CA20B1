Program: Three versions of the summation function have been presented in this chapter.
One uses a loop, one uses recursion, and one uses the reduce function. Discuss the
costs and benefits of each version, in terms of programmer time and computational
resources required.
Solution:
    # Loop:
    - Benefits:
    + You can perform a statement for many times you want
    - Cost:
    + It can waste the space in your program
    # Recursion:
    - Benefits:
    + Recursive solutions are often more natural and elegant than their iterative
    counterparts
    + Recursive function arises when the programmer fails to specify the base case or to reduce
    the size of the problem in a way that terminates the recursive process
    - The costs:
    + The run-time system on a real computer, such as the PVM, must devote some overhead to recursive function calls
    + When, because of a design error, the recursion is infinite, the stack
    frames are added until the PVM runs out of memory, which halts the program with an
    error message.
    + By contrast, the same problem can often be solved using a loop with a constant amount of
    memory, in the form of two or three variables. Because the amount of memory needed for
    the loop does not grow with the size of the problemâ€™s data set, the amount of processing
    time for managing this memory does not grow, either.
    + some problems with an iterative solution must still use an
    explicit stack-like data structure, so a recursive solution might be simpler and no less
    efficient.
    # Reduce:
