Program: How does one include an apostrophe as a character within a string literal
Solution:
    Some programming languages use different data types for strings and individual characters. In
    Python, character literals look just like string literals and are of the string type. To mark the difference in this book, we use single quotes to enclose single-character strings, and double quotes to
    enclose multi-character strings. Thus, we refer to 'H' as a character and "Hi!" as a string, even
    though they are both technically Python strings, and both are color-coded in green in this text.
