Program: Describe the processes of top-down design and stepwise refinement. Where does
the design start, and how does it proceed?
Solution:
    - Processes of top-down design:
     + One popular design strategy for programs of any significant size and complexity is
    called top-down design.
    - Processes of stepwise refinement:
    + As functions are developed to solve each subproblem, the solution to the
    overall problem is gradually filled out in detail. This process is also called stepwise
    refinement.
    - Where does the design start:
    + This strategy starts with a global view of the entire problem and breaks the problem into smaller, more manageable subproblemsâ€”a process
    known as problem decomposition.
    - How does it proceed:
    +  As each subproblem is isolated, its solution is
    assigned to a function. Problem decomposition may continue down to lower levels, because a subproblem might in turn contain two or more lower-level problems
    to solve
