Program: Translate the following for loops to equivalent while loops:
a. for count in range(100):
 print(count)
b. for count in range(1, 101):
 print(count)
c. for count in range(100, 0, –1):
 print(count)
Solution:
    a.  while count==100:
        print(count)
    b.  count=1
        while count<=100
        print(count)
    c.  count=100
        while count>=1
            print(count)
            count-=1
