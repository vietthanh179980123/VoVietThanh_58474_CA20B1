Program: Explain the relationship between a function and its arguments.
Solution:
    A function is a chunk of code that can be called by name to perform a task. Functions often
    require arguments, that is, specific data values, to perform their tasks. Names that refer to
    arguments are also known as parameters. When a function completes its task (which is

    another part of a program is known as returning a value
