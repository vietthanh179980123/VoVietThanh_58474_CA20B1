Program: How is information represented in hardware memory
Solution:
    Computer memory is set up to represent and store information in electronic form. Specifically, information is stored as patterns of binary digits (1s and 0s). To understand how this
    works, consider a basic device such as a light switch, which can only be in one of two states,
    on or off. Now suppose there is a bank of switches that control 16 small lights in a row. By
    turning the switches off or on, we can represent any pattern of 16 binary digits (1s and 0s)
    as patterns of lights that are on or off. As we will see later in this book, computer scientists
    have discovered how to represent any information, including text, images, and sound, in
    binary form.
