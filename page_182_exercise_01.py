Program: In what way is a recursive design different from top-down design?
Solution:
    - In top-down design, you decompose a complex problem into a set of simpler problems and
    solve these with different functions. In some cases, you can decompose a complex problem
    into smaller problems of the same form. In these cases, the subproblems can all be solved
    by using the same function. This design strategy is called recursive design, and the resulting functions are called recursive functions.
