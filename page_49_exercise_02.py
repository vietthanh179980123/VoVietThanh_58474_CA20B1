Program: Explain the differences between the data types int and float.
Solution: The differences between int and float are:
    Int is an integer, a number that has no digits after the decimal point. It can be positive or negative. Internally, integers are stored as binary numbers. On most computers, integers are 32-bit binary numbers, but this size can vary from one computer to another. When calculations are done with integers, anything after the decimal point is lost. So if you divided 2 by 3, the result is 0, not 0.6666.

    Float is a floating-point number, which is a number that can have digits after the decimal point. It can be positive or negative. Internally, floating-point numbers are stored in a special binary format that usually (but not always) corresponds to a format that can be handled directly by the computer hardware when doing arithmetic operations. Some formats are standardized, such as those of the IEEE. Whatever the internal format, floats are always numbers that can (but don't have to) contain digits after the decimal point. On many computers, an ordinary float has a precision of about six digits (meaning the total number of digits it can keep track of is about six, including both those before and after the decimal point).
