Program: What role do translators play in the programming process
Solution:
    A programmer typically starts by writing high-level language statements in a text editor.
    The programmer then runs another program called a translator to convert the high-level
    program code into executable code. Because it is possible for a programmer to make grammatical mistakes even when writing high-level code, the translator checks for syntax errors
    before it completes the translation process. If it detects any of these errors, the translator
    alerts the programmer via error messages. The programmer then has to revise the program.
    If the translation process succeeds without a syntax error, the program can be executed
    by the run-time system. The run-time system might execute the program directly on the
    hardware or run yet another program called an interpreter or virtual machine to execute
    the program.
