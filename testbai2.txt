Write a program that allows the user to navigate the lines of text in a file. The
program should prompt the user for a filename and input the lines of text into a
list. The program then enters a loop in which it prints the number of lines in the
file and prompts the user for a line number. Actual line numbers range from 1 to
the number of lines in the file. If the input is 0, the program quits. Otherwise, the
program prints the line associated with that number.
