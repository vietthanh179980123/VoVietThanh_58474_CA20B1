Program: List four phases of the software development process, and explain what they
accomplish.
Solution:
    1. Customer request—In this phase, the programmers receive a broad statement of
    a problem that is potentially amenable to a computerized solution. This step is also
    called the user requirements phase.
    2. Analysis—The programmers determine what the program will do. This is sometimes viewed as a process of clarifying the specifications for the problem.
    3. Design—The programmers determine how the program will do its task.
    4. Implementation—The programmers write the program. This step is also called the
    coding phase
