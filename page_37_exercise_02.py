Program: Jack says that he will not bother with analysis and design but proceed directly to
coding his programs. Why is that not a good idea?
Solution:
    Because modern software development is usually incremental and iterative. This means that analysis and design may produce a
    rough draft, skeletal version, or prototype of a system for coding, and then back up to earlier phases to fill in more details after some testing. For purposes of introducing this process, however, we treat these phases as distinct.
    Programs rarely work as hoped the first time they are run; hence, they should be subjected
    to extensive and careful testing. Many people think that testing is an activity that applies
    only to the implementation and integration phases; however, you should scrutinize the outputs of each phase carefully. Keep in mind that mistakes found early are much less
    expensive to correct than those found late. Figure 2-2 illustrates some relative costs of
    repairing mistakes when found in different phases. These are not just financial costs but
    also costs in time and effort.
